# What is Java?

> Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

```bash
$ docker run -it --name java bitnami/java
```

## Docker Compose

```bash
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-java/master/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up -d
```

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* Bitnami images are built on CircleCI and automatically pushed to the Docker Hub.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading linux distribution.

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Java Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/java).

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/java:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/java/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/java:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```bash
$ docker build -t bitnami/java https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-java.git
```

# Configuration

## Running your Java jar or war

The default work directory for the Java image is `/app`. You can mount a folder from your host here that includes your Java jar or war, and run it normally using the `java` command.

```bash
$ docker run -it --name java -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/java:latest \
  java -jar package.jar
```

or using Docker Compose:

```
java:
  image: bitnami/java:latest
  command: "java -jar package.jar"
  volumes:
    - .:/app
```

# Maintenance

## Upgrade this image

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of Java, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container.

### Step 1: Get the updated image

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/java:latest
```

or if you're using Docker Compose, update the value of the image property to `bitnami/java:latest`.

### Step 2: Remove the currently running container

```bash
$ docker rm -v java
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose rm -v java
```

### Step 3: Run the new image

Re-create your container from the new image.

```bash
$ docker run --name java bitnami/java:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose up java
```
